The choice depends on the specific application within an Electrostatic Protected Area (EPA).</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits of ESD Tape</h2>
        <h3>Static Protection</h3><p>Its primary benefit is protecting sensitive components from damaging electrostatic discharge during manufacturing, assembly, and packaging.</p>
        <h3>Clean Adhesive</h3><p>ESD tapes are designed with adhesives that hold securely but can be removed cleanly without leaving residue that could interfere with electronic processes.</p>
        <h3>No Residue</h3><p>Clean removal is critical in electronics to ensure no contaminants are left on circuit boards or components.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <h3>PCB Masking</h3><p>High-temperature ESD tapes like <a href="/product/esd-kapton-tape" class="text-brand-accent hover:underline font-semibold">ESD Kapton tape</a> are used to mask off areas of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) during wave soldering.</p>
        <h3>Electronics Packaging</h3><p>Used to seal ESD-safe bags and containers that hold sensitive components, ensuring a static-safe environment during shipping and storage.</p>
        <h3>Lab Environments</h3><p>Used for general purpose holding, sealing, and labeling within an EPA where standard adhesive tapes are prohibited.</p>

        <h2>FAQs about ESD Tape</h2>
        <p><strong>Is ESD tape conductive?</strong><br/>Some are (like copper foil tape), but most common types are static dissipative. They are designed to control static, not necessarily conduct a current. For example, conductive grid tape has a buried conductive layer but a dissipative surface.</p>
        <p><strong>Where to use anti-static tape?</strong><br/>It should be used for any application within an Electrostatic Protected Area (EPA), such as electronics manufacturing labs, assembly lines, and repair depots, where standard tapes could generate a damaging static charge.</p>
